            <div style="font-size: 20px">
                I moved to Tokyo, Japan a week before entering my first company, Rakuten.
                Due to Rakuten's reputation I had the privilege of a third-party company assisting me with many necessities (phone, bank account, CC, etc).
                I joined Rakuten in April 2014 and took part in the company-wide training for new recruits, but much to my dismay many services and even internal documents were completely in Japanese.
                <br><br>
                It seemed that although Rakuten touts itself as an culturally diverse company and very friendly for foreigners, they made little to no effort to make their services accessible to them.
                Fortunately, many things happened in the next two years (mainly non-Japanese employees speaking out) and Rakuten started to provide internal assistance for services such as card, bank, and even loans.
                <br><br>
                That said, assistance to non-employees continued to be minute. With a corporation as huge as Rakuten, changes happen too slowly for many people's liking.
                Requests to provide English versions of their webpages or documents will likely fall on deaf ears due to non-Japanese residents being a huge minority.
                <br><br>
                I have since left the corporation, but have read a variety of complaints that only continue to increase.
                Thus, I dedicate this site to all of those who are new to Japan and choose Rakuten as an easy means of getting a bank account and credit card (Yes, it is easier compared to other companies..!).
                Hopefully these guides will help you in squeezing that extra bit of convenience out of Rakuten in addition to increasing your chances of passing screenings for card/bank.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, this website is practice for me to hone my skills in HTML/JS/CSS. I am a solutions engineer, not a professional web designer..!

                Thank you and I hope this site will be of some use to you.
