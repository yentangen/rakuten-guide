            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>Rakuten Bank is an online service that aims to provide various banking services to customers.
              Those who use or subscribe to various Rakuten services will often enjoy additional benefits for their banking needs.
              Just like with Rakuten Card, there are no physical offices you can go to so everything is managed online instead.
              Having an account with Rakuten is recommended if you heavily use things such as Card, Securities, Edy, or Super Points.
              In any case, you can read about a non-exhaustive list of advantages and disadvantages below:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Rakuten Card" src="tutorials/bank/rakuten-bank-card.jpg"><br>
            </div>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">All services available over the internet</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Enjoy additional benefits when linking bank to many other Rakuten services.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Deposits can be done at Yuucho, and withdrawals from Yuucho and many popular convenience stores.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">It's possible to have up to 5 transfers and 5 withdrawals free per month based on your "Happy Program" ranking.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">If you ran out of free transfers and withdrawals, the fee can be pretty high (especially weekends/holidays)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Extra work may be necessary to link other company's services to Rakuten Bank (for billing/transfer purposes)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Interest returns on your balance are lower compared to other companies.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
              <p>You, obviously, need to reside in Japan and also have at least one of:<br>
                 - Japanese Driver's License<br>
                 - Health Insurance Card<br>
                 - Residence Card<br><br>
                After you submit the application you will be asked to submit proof of document for one of the above. This can be done via mobile application
                or via snail mail. For obvious reason I recommend using the Rakuten Bank mobile app to upload images of your formal document of choice.<br><br>
                In addition, <b>if you haven't registered for a Rakuten group account yet, then I strongly advise you do so</b> as the below guide is tailored for those
                who already have an account. Don't worry, the registration should be very straightforward (Last/First Name, username, password, e-mail address).
              </p>
            <h2>Some Notes...</h2>
              <p><b>Don't stay too long on a screen or else it will TIMEOUT and you will have to do it All. Over. Again.</b> If you are slow in filling out Japanese forms
                then I recommend you look over this guide first and prepare in however way you wish before proceeding.
              </p>
            <h2>Application Process</h2>
              <h3>Getting to Application Form</h3>
              <p>
                Go to <a href="http://www.rakuten-bank.co.jp">Rakuten Bank's Home Page</a> and click on the green button in the right navigation bar.
                <img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="www.rakuten-bank.co.jp" src="tutorials/bank/landing_screen.png"><br><br>
                As I mentioned in prerequisites area, you should already have a Rakuten group account.
                Therefore, click on the RED button shown below and login using your group account. It will autofill some fields for your convenience.

                If you're like me who has strange characters in your name (such as a hyphen in first name), then omit it completely.<br>
                (eg "SMITH, ANNA-MARIE" should be "SMITH, ANNAMARIE")<br>
                <b>2)</b> If you registered your Rakuten group account using English name then this should be autofilled with "ー　ー". You can choose to leave as is or replace with Katakana reading.<br>
                <b>3)</b> Left for Male, right for female. Nothing confusing here.<br>
                <b>4)</b> Birthday. Nothing special here. <br>
                <b>5)</b> "Please check this box if you do not have Japanese citizenship. Those with Japanese citizenship need not check this box."<br> Hint: you should check this box.<br>

            <h2>What To Do After</h2>
            <p>
              You are required to submit proof that you reside and work in Japan. You have the choice between multiple documents you can submit.
              The two most commonly used documents are your Residence Card or your Health Insurance Card. Choose one you prefer, download the Rakuten
              Bank App, and submit front/back images of your document through it. (Unfortunately I don't have a test account so I cannot create a
              tutorial for this, but there's no rush so please ask a trusted Japanese friend to help you!)
              <br><br>
              Search "Rakuten Bank" or "楽天銀行" on your phone, or scan the QR code on the receipt screen (OR, you can even scan the QR code in the above image!)
