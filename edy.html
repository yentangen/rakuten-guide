          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Rakuten Edy is THE most popular E-money in Japan, and is usable at many places especially those that do not have their own point system.
              In present-day Japan there are many opportunities to earn some kind of points with any kind of transaction. While there are too many point
              programs to count, unless you go to some small and unknown shop that only accepts cash, you can earn points if you just use 電子マネー (E-money)
              instead of cash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's use an example - suppose you have a habit of purchasing a bento after work every evening. You go to a convenience store to buy your dinner.
              There is an option to pay using Suica or Pasmo, among many other types of E-moneys. If you don't have a system set up, then you may
              think that using Suica/Pasmo has no benefit to you other than the idea that you can carry less cash on you. However, let's say you use Rakuten Edy
              for your purchase instead. You will receive 1 Rakuten Super Point for every 200JPY you spend. That sounds nice until you hear something even better:
              if you have a Rakuten Card you can autocharge your Edy, and the amount charged will be billed to your Rakuten Card, which will earn you additional
              1% based on the amount you charged.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be honest, Edy is nice to use but it doesn't "integrate" well with services outside of Rakuten. That said, I wouldn't recommend getting an Edy card
              just for the hell of it - only get it with your CC if you happen to apply for a Rakuten Card. If you have Rakuten Card with Edy feature then you can set
              up autocharge on it which will net you 1% Super Points based on the amount that you bill to your card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edy can be converted to Rakuten Super Points, which can then be used to convert to other points. A notable one is that you can exchange 2 Super Points for
              one point of ANA mileage. Since there are no ways to earn Edy points for free, this feature is very seldom used since you are the one who charged it in the
              first place.
            </p>
            <h2>Making the most out of Edy</h2>
            <h3>Charging it with Rakuten Card</h3>
            <p>
              As mentioned in the introduction section, charging your Edy with credit card will give you Edy points and also bill the amount to your card. If your card
              has a points system, then you should receive points from it too. <b>Unfortunately, you can't charge using anything other than Rakuten card</b>, making Edy
              a not-so-convenient E-money to have with you.<br><br>
              If you do use either the Autocharge feature or いつでもチャージ (anytime charge) feature, then you will receive additional Rakuten Super Points when they
              bestow the points from Rakuten Card to you.
